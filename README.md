## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes global shark attack data to identify trends, high-risk locations, and factors influencing incidents. The insights are visualized in an interactive **Power BI dashboard**.

## 📂 Data Sources
- Publicly available shark attack datasets
- Cleaned and structured data prepared in Power BI


## 🛠 Tools
- **Power BI** (Dashboard creation & visualization)
- **Power Query** (Data cleaning & transformation)
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** (Advanced calculations)

## 🔍 Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Removed duplicates & missing values
- Standardized date and time formats
- Extracted species names from descriptions
- Categorized time of attack into morning, afternoon, evening, and night

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis
### Key Insights

#### 📈 **Annual Shark Attacks Over Time**
- Trend of shark attacks since 1900 shows fluctuations with peaks in certain periods.
- Recent decades indicate an increase in reported attacks.
#### 🌍 **Most Affected Countries & High-Risk Areas**
- USA, Australia, and South Africa report the most shark attacks.
- Florida, New South Wales, and Western Cape have high incidences.
#### ⏰ **Time of Day for Most Attacks**
- Majority of attacks occur **in the afternoon** when more people are in the water.
#### 🚨 **Most Commonly Injured Body Parts**
- **Legs and feet** are the most commonly injured body parts in shark attacks.
#### 🏊 **Activities Leading to Shark Attacks**
- **Surfing and swimming** account for the highest number of attacks.

## 🔎 Data Analysis
- Identified **countries with the highest attacks**
- Analyzed **dangerous locations within these countries**
- Determined **most vulnerable body parts**
- Examined **time of day & seasonal attack trends**
- Correlated **human activities with shark attacks**

## 📢 Results & Findings
- Shark attacks have increased over time, especially in coastal regions of **USA, Australia, and South Africa**.
- Attacks occur most frequently **in the afternoon**, likely due to human activity in the water.
- **Legs and feet** are the most commonly affected body parts.
- **Surfing and swimming** pose the highest risk of encounters with sharks.

  
## 🔑 Recommendations
- **Stay in groups** while swimming
- **Use shark deterrents** when engaging in water sports
- **Follow local safety warnings** in high-risk areas
- - **Avoid peak attack times**: Minimize water activities in the afternoon.
- **Be cautious in high-risk areas**
- **Use protective gear**: Wetsuits with shark-repellent technology could reduce risks.
- **Public Awareness**: Increased education on safe water practices can help mitigate risks.

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Some attacks have **incomplete or missing data** and some columns with excessive null values were removed
- **Underreporting** was observed in certain regions  and this may affect accuracy
- Some locations may underreport attacks due to lack of proper documentation.
